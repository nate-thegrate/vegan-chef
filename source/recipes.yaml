sourdough bread:
  meal: side dish
  ingredients:
    - 300 g water
    - 100 g sourdough starter
    - 10 g salt

    - Mix the water, starter, and salt in a bowl. Then mix in everything else.
    - Cover and let rise for 18-24 hours.
    - Grease a bread pan. Knead the risen dough for a bit (kinda like pulling taffy) and then set in the bread pan. Then let it rise for a couple more hours.
    - Bake at 375째F for 50 minutes. Then take it out of the pan and let it cool for a few minutes.
    - It might be worth it to buy an electric knife, since sourdough has a hard crust that's difficult to slice through.

    - Using a rolling pin, spread the dough out into a large rectangle, and then cut it into squares with a pizza cutter.
    - Heat the oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat, and then fry each sourdough square, flipping halfway through.
    - Serve with honey, cinnamon-sugar, nutella, icing, jam, or even something savory if you'd like!
