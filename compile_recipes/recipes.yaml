    - Using a rolling pin, spread the dough out into a large rectangle. Mix the cinnamon spread ingredients and spread on top.
    - Roll the dough up and use dental floss to cut it into individual rolls (about 1 in thick).
    - Put the rolls in a pan and set the pan in the oven. Set the oven to 350°F for 3 min to warm it up a bit, and then turn the oven off.
    - Let the cinnamon rolls rise for 30-45 min. Then set oven to 350°F and bake for 20 min.
    - <br>For the icing, if the allulose/erythritol/salt aren't in powder form, stick them in the blender until they are.
