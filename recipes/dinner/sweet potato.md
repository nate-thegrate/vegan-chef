# sweet potato

### ingredients
- 1 sweet potato

<br>

### directions:

Use a fork to puncture the potato skin a bunch.

Bake at 425Â°F for 70 minutes. It's probably a good idea to put tin foil or parchment paper underneath to reduce cleanup hassle.

Put whatever you'd like on top. (I like cinnamon since it reminds me of Thanksgiving)
