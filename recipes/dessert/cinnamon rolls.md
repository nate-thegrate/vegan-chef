*yield: 24 servings*

### ingredients
- 2 cups water
- 1/4 cup potato flakes
- 1/4 cup oil
- 1/2 cup sourdough starter
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 4 cups whole wheat flour
- 1 tablespoon yeast
- 1/8 cup wheat gluten

#### cinnamon spread
- 1/2 cup plant-based butter
- 1/2 teaspoon sucralose
- 1/4 cup cinnamon


#### icing
- 8 oz plant-based cream cheese
- 2 tablespoons plant-based butter

- 1/2 cup Fibersol (optional)
- 2 cups allulose
- 1/2 cup erythritol
- 1/8 teaspoon salt

### directions:

Set out the butter and cream cheese so they have time to reach room temperature.

Combine all ingredients (except for the cinnamon spread) and mix, either in a bread machine or by hand, and let rise for about an hour.

Using a rolling pin, spread the dough out into a large rectangle. Mix the cinnamon spread ingredients and spread on top.

Roll the dough up and use dental floss to cut it into individual rolls (about 1 in thick).

Put the rolls in a pan and set the pan in the oven. Set the oven to 350°F for 3 min to warm it up a bit, and then turn the oven off.

Let the cinnamon rolls rise for 30-45 min. Then set oven to 350°F and bake for 20 min.

<br>For the icing, if the allulose/erythritol/salt aren't in powder form, stick them in the blender until they are.

Then combine the icing ingredients using an electric mixer and spread it on the cinnamon rolls (once they've had a few minutes to cool).
