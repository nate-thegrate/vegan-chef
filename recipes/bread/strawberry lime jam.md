### directions:

Heat the strawberries & lime juice in a pot, using a potato masher to smash the strawberries into jam.

Stir it as it simmers for a few minutes, then mix in the sweetener and chia seeds and let it cool.

(Amounts aren't listed since it depends on personal preference, and there's usually no consistency in the amount of strawberries I'm working with.)
