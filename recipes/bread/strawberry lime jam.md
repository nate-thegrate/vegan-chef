### ingredients

- lime juice
- lots of sweetener
- chia seeds
- guar gum (optional)

<br>

### directions:

Heat the strawberries & lime juice in a pot, using a potato masher to smash the strawberries into jam.

Either add some thickener or wait for some of the excess water to boil off (chia seeds make a pretty good thickener anyway).

Once the strawberries seem cooked to your satisfaction, add the sweetener & chia seeds, and then let it cool.

Alternatively, you can use sugar-free lemonade mix in place of lime juice, which will also reduce the amount of sweetener needed.
