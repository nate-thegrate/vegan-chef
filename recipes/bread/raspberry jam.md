<br>

### directions:

Heat the raspberries in a pot, using a potato masher to smash them into jam.

Stir it as it simmers for a few minutes, then mix in the sweetener & guar gum and let it cool.

(Amounts aren't listed since it depends on personal preference, and there's usually no consistency in the amount of strawberries I'm working with.)
