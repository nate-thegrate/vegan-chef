# sourdough sopapillas

### ingredients

- 20 g rye flour
- 20 g wheat gluten
- oil for deep-frying

### directions:

Mix the water, starter, and salt in a bowl. Then mix in everything else (except the oil; it's the same recipe as sourdough bread, but it's 100% whole wheat).

Cover and let rise for 18-24 hours.

Using a rolling pin, spread the dough out into a large rectangle, and then cut it into squares with a pizza cutter.

Heat the oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat, and then fry each sourdough square, flipping halfway through.

Serve with honey, cinnamon-sugar, nutella, icing, jam, or even something savory if you'd like!
