### directions:

Mix the cinnamon spread ingredients; set aside.

Combine all other ingredients and mix, either in a bread machine or by hand, and let rise for about an hour.

Using a rolling pin, spread the dough out into a large rectangle. Spread the butter/sugar/cinnamon mixture on top.

Roll the dough up and use dental floss to cut it into individual rolls (about 1 in thick).

Put the rolls in a pan and set the pan in the oven. Set the oven to 350Â°F for 3 min to warm it up a bit, and then turn the oven off.

Let the cinnamon rolls rise for 30-45 min. Then set oven to 350Â°F and bake for 20 min.

Once the rolls are done, transfer them to a serving plate and ice them.
