# bagels
*yield: 8 servings*

### ingredients
- 1 cup water
- 1/8 cup oil
- 1/2 cup sourdough starter
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups whole wheat flour
- 1/2 tablespoon yeast
- 1/8 cup wheat gluten
- 7 oz plant-based sour cream

### directions:

Combine all ingredients and mix, either in a bread machine or by hand, and let rise for about 90 minutes.

Cut dough into 8 pieces and roll into balls, making a hole in each ball. (Feel free to look up a video before you do it the first time.)

Set the oven to 350°F for 3 min to warm it up a bit, and then turn the oven off. Let the bagels rise in the oven for about 10 minutes.

Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.

Remove bagels from oven, and preheat oven to 425°F.

Boil each bagel for 3 minutes, flipping halfway through (so 90 seconds for each side).

Once all bagels are boiled, return them to the baking sheet, and bake at 425°F for 20 minutes.

Let the bagels cool and serve however you like (e.g. by spreading plant-based sour cream or cream cheese on top).
