# sourdough bread

### ingredients
- 300 g water

- 20 g rye flour
- 20 g wheat gluten

### directions:

Mix the water, starter, and salt in a bowl. Then mix in everything else.

Cover and let rise for 18-24 hours.

Grease a bread pan. Knead the risen dough for a bit (kinda like pulling taffy) and then set in the bread pan. Then let it rise for a couple more hours.

Bake at 375Â°F for 50 minutes. Then take it out of the pan and let it cool for a few minutes.

It might be worth it to buy an electric knife, since sourdough has a hard crust that's difficult to slice through.
